# comparing two units might be possible after all, eg by creating a boundary ID raster showing the most likely unit in each source
# then can compare each unique pair of boundary IDs from each source and calc the disjoint prob surface
# and for each pair burn the disagreement prob surface onto a final output for those pixels
